## Architecture Decision Records

<adr_governance source="docs/adr/">
ADRs govern validated architectural standards for this project.
Full ADR documents: @docs/adr/
</adr_governance>

<activation>
These directives are ALWAYS ACTIVE. All AI coding agents MUST apply all rules in this
document to every code generation, modification, and review action within this
project. No exceptions unless explicitly noted per-rule.
</activation>

---

### Verification Protocol

<verification_protocol>
All rules in this document follow the **Verify → Fix → Repeat** loop.
</verification_protocol>

After generating or modifying code for any rule, the agent MUST:

1. **RUN** the targeted verification command(s) in the rule's **Verify** block.
2. **CAPTURE** the full command output (stdout + stderr).
3. **EVALUATE** whether the **Accept when** criteria are satisfied.
4. **IF FAILING:** diagnose the root cause, apply a fix, and re-run from step 1.
5. **IF PASSING:** include the passing output as inline evidence before proposing further changes.
6. **MAX ITERATIONS:** 5 attempts per rule. If still failing after 5 attempts, STOP and report the failure with all captured outputs.

<enforcement>
Compliance is not optional. Agents must not skip verification steps, assume
correctness, or defer verification to a later task. Evidence of a passing
verification run must accompany every code change that touches a governed area.
</enforcement>

# Agent Guidelines for Documenso

## Build/Test/Lint Commands

- `npm run build` - Build all packages
- `npm run lint` - Lint all packages
- `npm run lint:fix` - Auto-fix linting issues
- `npm run test:e2e` - Run E2E tests with Playwright
- `npm run test:dev -w @documenso/app-tests` - Run single E2E test in dev mode
- `npm run test-ui:dev -w @documenso/app-tests` - Run E2E tests with UI
- `npm run format` - Format code with Biome
- `npm run dev` - Start development server for Remix app

**Important:** Do not run `npm run build` to verify changes unless explicitly asked. Builds take a long time (~2 minutes). Use `npx tsc --noEmit` for type checking specific packages if needed.

## Code Style Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer `type` over `interface`
- Use functional components with `const Component = () => {}`
- Never use classes; prefer functional/declarative patterns
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (isLoading, hasError)
- Directory names: lowercase with dashes (auth-wizard)
- Use named exports for components
- Never use 'use client' directive
- Never use 1-line if statements
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types

## Error Handling & Validation

- Use custom AppError class when throwing errors
- When catching errors on the frontend use `const error = AppError.parse(error)` to get the error code
- Use early returns and guard clauses
- Use Zod for form validation and react-hook-form for forms
- Use error boundaries for unexpected errors

## UI & Styling

- Use Shadcn UI, Radix, and Tailwind CSS with mobile-first approach
- Use `<Form>` `<FormItem>` elements with fieldset having `:disabled` attribute when loading
- Use Lucide icons with longhand names (HomeIcon vs Home)

## TRPC Routes

- Each route in own file: `routers/teams/create-team.ts`
- Associated types file: `routers/teams/create-team.types.ts`
- Request/response schemas: `Z[RouteName]RequestSchema`, `Z[RouteName]ResponseSchema`
- Only use GET and POST methods in OpenAPI meta
- Deconstruct input argument on its own line
- Prefer route names such as get/getMany/find/create/update/delete
- "create" routes request schema should have the ID and data in the top level
- "update" routes request schema should have the ID in the top level and the data in a nested "data" object

## Translations & Remix

- Use `<Trans>string</Trans>` for JSX translations from `@lingui/react/macro`
- Use `t\`string\`` macro for TypeScript translations
- Use `(params: Route.Params)` and `(loaderData: Route.LoaderData)` for routes
- Directly return data from loaders, don't use `json()`
- Use `superLoaderJson` when sending complex data through loaders such as dates or prisma decimals
